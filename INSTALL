Installation instructions for running Raspberry Pi slideshow

Install latest Raspbian OS to SD card and boot pi

Update aptitude sources

sudo apt-get update

Install following applications:

matchbox window manager - light weight window manager
sudo apt-get install matchbox

rsync - file synchronisation application
sudo apt-get install rsync

libreoffice - office suite including presentation application
sudo apt-get install libreoffice

Copy .xsession to /home/pi - assuming this is the user id setup to run on bootup
This script starts the display manager and syncs the default user home with a fresh copy
from /opt - it also deletes any previous libreoffice config allowing clean start of slideshow

Create a copy of the default user (pi) in /opt

cp -r /home/pi /opt/
cd /opt/pi/
chmod -R a+r .
chmod a+x .xsession

Create a slidshow named slideshow.odp and copy to /opt/pi - this will autostart on bootup

Restart the pi and stand back and enjoy your show
